This is a Sandcastle Help File Builder (https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB) project for the Galactic API. It uses the SharedLibraries and Galactic API project as documentation sources.

This repository should generally be placed at the same level in the directory structure as the Galactic and SharedLibraries project.

For example:

If you place the Galactic and SharedLibraries project in:
C:\Users\Username\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\Galactic
C:\Users\Username\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\SharedLibraries

then this project should be placed in: C:\Users\Username\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\GalacticDocumentation
